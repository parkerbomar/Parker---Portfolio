      <p><span class="first-character a2"></span>This is Lena. Its not actually a photo of her but I was too lazy to find a decent photo and this photo from Pexels a royalty free image site looked close enough. My Lena has a thicker coat of fur and a more bored look to her face but thats about all. she is a pretty chill dog. She was once a show dog but now she spends every waking second chilling on the nice chair that we have long since stopped asking her to get off of. I hope I can live a lazy life like Lena one day.<br><br>Likes: <br>Being outside <br>

    <p><span class="first-character a3">O</span>ne day when I was working on my final project for interaction design, my friend from another class posted a cute picture of a kitten she had rescued. I immediately noticed it was the cutest kitten ever and told her I would take it. It was so fluffy and small, and I had never owned a cat before, but I was pretty sure it was the sweetest cat to ever exist. Anyways, I thought the cat was a girl, until I took it to the vet to get the rabies shots. Turns out my kitty is a boy! I had to change his name from ‚ÄúLuna‚Äù to ‚ÄúBear‚Äù. <br><br> When he was little, he was a mixture of black and red, but now he is all black. He loves being in my apartment because he gets a lot of time to himself, but also can come snuggle me when he wants to. Bear thinks he is a dog because he spends all of his free time with dogs. He even tries to eat dog food instead of cat food. I guess that works out for me, because I have only ever owned dogs! Bear is officially 7 months old now, and he has become even more sweet than he was the first day I got him. </p>

  <div class="block">
    <p><span class="first-character a3">W</span>hen I turned 15, Bubba was my birthday gift! He was so little and fluffy and cute. I had been asking for a pet Yorkie-Poo forever. My parents tried to hide him from me until my birthday, but Bubba was very loud and I ended up finding his hiding place. Now, Bubba is 8 years old and still crazy as ever. He just had surgery and had to lose all of his teeth, so he looks a little silly, but he can still play fetch! It took him a long time to figure out how to hold a ball again. His favorite hobby is swimming. 
<br><br>
Bubba is not the smartest dog ever, but he is definitely the sweetest. He enjoys cuddles, but then wants to be alone and will hide under the bed where no one can get to him. His best friend is Camo, ho is an Australian Shepherd. Camo intimidates him sometimes, because he is so much bigger, but he makes sure Bubba knows he would never hurt him. Bubba loves bacon grease and back scratches. It is his job to warn us if anybody is about to ring the doorbell.

    <p><span class="first-character a3">üêØ</span>I‚Äôm not really sure where the picture of the tiger came from, since this was a pet blog. Do my group mates expect me to talk about how I own a tiger as a pet? Am I meant to present this to the class, with a straight face, like I just walk home every night and let my tiger out for an evening stroll? This isn‚Äôt a pet. Legally, though, you could own a tiger as a pet. In Texas. I imagine that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre so pro-gun down there. There‚Äôs just tigers everywhere, man. Don‚Äôt believe me? Google, ‚Äúpopulation of tigers in‚Ä¶‚Äù and just watch autofill take you to Texas. Do you think there‚Äôs a Texan Tiger Breeder? I‚Äôve never seen a tiger show, but I think it would be a strong pitch to the right network. If you‚Äôre picking up what I‚Äôm putting down, let‚Äôs go talk to Animal Planet. </p>

  <div class="block">
    <p><span class="first-character a3"></span>At some point, when deciding what to do our website on, someone jokingly said, ‚Äúwhat about our pets or something?‚Äù and it just stuck. I‚Äôm really at a loss for words, but at this point, we‚Äôve committed. Anyways, I live with a roommate who has a cat. He‚Äôs cute, and snuggly (the cat, not the roommate). He‚Äôs also a garbage monster that will keep you up all hours of the night (both the roommate and the cat). People keep asking me if this picture is the cat I‚Äôm talking about, and it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs a stock photo because the purpose of this website was to show how we used javascript to move the images at different scroll speeds to give a parallax effect. To be honest, we didn‚Äôt really even have an expectation on word count, and I volunteered to write two pages worth of content, so I‚Äôll see you on the next page. The last episode of Game of Thrones was still a lot of character development and not really a lot of action. I wasn‚Äôt that impressed. Neither was the cat</p>
